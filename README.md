War is a very long winded two player card game. Press 'play' to play one round - each player turns over one card and the highest card wins. If the card matches, you start a war, and both players turn a card face down, then another card face up. The highest card wins all six cards. The first player to have all 52 cards in their hand wins!

☠️ WARNING ☠️: This might take some time, so we have added a speed mode 🏎.

## The Project

This was writtenby @arrested-developer and @dupreesi as a 2-day project during React Week, inspired by the possibilities of deckofcardsapi.com 🃏

### Challenges

- Using React for the first time!
- Lifting state up.
- Finding a game simple enough to make into a React app in a short space of time, yet complex enough to be engaging. (Spoiler - we failed miserably. This game could be marketed as a sleep aid 😴)

### Further stretch goals

- Pre-cache images from the api
