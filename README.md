## Description

War is a very long winded two player card game. Press 'play' to play one round - each player turns over one card and the highest card wins. If the card matches, you start a war, and both players turn a card face down, then another card face up. The highest card wins all six cards. The first player to have all 52 cards in their hand wins!

This might take some time, so we have added a speed mode.
